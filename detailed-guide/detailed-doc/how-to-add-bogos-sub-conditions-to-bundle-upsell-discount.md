# How to Add BOGOS Sub-conditions to Bundle, Upsell, Discount?

Overall, sub-conditions **add extra rules to decide who can see and get your offers**. Therefore, only targeted customers can see and apply the offer, while others won't see it at all.

{% hint style="info" %}
* These sub-conditions are optional. If you don't add any, the offer will be available to all customers.
* You can combine multiple sub-conditions in one offer. Customers must meet all of them to qualify for your offer.
{% endhint %}

### Feature List Overview

See this feature list to understand which sub-conditions are available for each offer type before setting up your promotion:

_**\*Upsell Trigger:** Set these conditions in Upsell Trigger → Customer trigger in_ [_Checkout Upsell_](../upsell-offer/create-checkout-upsell.md#id-2.4-customer-trigger) _or_ [_Thank You Page Upsell_](../upsell-offer/create-thank-you-page-upsell.md#customer-trigger) _set up, not in the sub-conditions section._

### 1. Specific Link Address

This condition only allows customers who access your store through a specific link to get your offers. Use this for email campaigns, social media posts, or influencer partnerships to target specific traffic sources.

_**Create a specific link address for an offer:**_

1. _Choose a link destination:_ Select where customers should land (home page, collection page, or product page).
2. _Enter a word to customize_ (e.g., summersale2024): This creates a unique link for your campaign.
3. _Copy the link generated:_ Copy and share this link in your marketing campaigns. Customers who access your store via this link will get your offers.

_**Create many link destinations for an offer:**_

If you want to have multiple link destinations (not just the one selected above), for example, use this when your campaign promotes multiple products, and you want customers to enter from different product links to get your offer, follow these steps:

1. _Repeat steps_ to create a specific link address for an offer
2. _**Copy the parameter**_ and add it to the end of each link.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your URL already includes a “?” symbol, **change the “?” in the parameter to “&”.** Examples:

* Original URL with “?”: https://yourstore.com/product?variant=12345
* URL with correct parameter: https://yourstore.com/product?variant=1234&#x35;**&**&#x66;reegifts\_code=summersale2024
* URL with wrong parameter: https://yourstore.com/product?variant=1234&#x35;**?**&#x66;reegifts\_code=summersale2024
{% endhint %}

* _Total number of orders placed:_ Target customers based on how many orders they’ve made (e.g., first-time or repeat buyers).
