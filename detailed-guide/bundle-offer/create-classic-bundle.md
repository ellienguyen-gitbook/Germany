### 1. Bundle information

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (368).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### 1.1 Bundle name

This name is for internal management only and won’t be visible to customers.

#### 1.2 Bundle title

The bundle title is the name of the bundle, it will be displayed on the top of the bundle as the block header

#### 1.3 Bundle description&#x20;

The bundle description provides customers with more information about the deal being offered. This field is optional.&#x20;

#### 1.4 Start time and End time&#x20;

* **Start time:** The time that bundle becomes active and visible to customers on Online store and product page&#x20;
* **End time:** The time that the bundle becomes deactivated on the Online store and product page. Leave this field blank to let the bundle work continuously.&#x20;

#### 1.5. Show countdown timer (optional)

Enable a countdown timer on the widget to motivate customers to buy before the offer ends.

* This option is disabled by default. It becomes available once you set an End time or enable Recurring time.
* Without Recurring time, the countdown runs based on the End time.
* When Recurring time is set, the countdown runs based on each recurring session's End time (in days).

#### 1.6. Recurring time (optional)

Enable the offer on a repeating schedule within its active period, ideal for daily flash sales, weekend promotions, or monthly campaigns. When enabled, the active period's End time is automatically synced with the recurrence end date.

To set it up, configure the following:

**1.6.1. Frequency**

Select how often the offer repeats: Daily, Weekly, or Monthly.

* **Daily:** The offer runs every day within the chosen time window.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (435).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Weekly:** The offer runs on selected days of the week.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (437).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Monthly:** The offer runs on a specific day each month. If you select day 29, 30, or 31, the offer will repeat on the month's last day if that date doesn't exist.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (441).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**1.6.2. Start time (in day) / End time (in day)**

The daily time window when the offer is active during each recurring session (e.g., 09:00 to 11:00). Times are set to your store's current timezone.

**1.6.3. End recurring when**

Choose when the recurrence stops.

* **No end date:** The offer keeps recurring until you manually deactivate it.
* **On date:** The offer stops on a specific date. If you already set an End time, this field defaults to that date, but you can still change it.
* **After N times:** The offer stops after it has run a set number of times.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When created with Recurring time enabled, the offer appears with Scheduled status so you can track upcoming runs.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If an offer expires while a customer is still in the checkout process, the discount is automatically removed, and products are charged at their original price.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### 2. Add sub-conditions

Sub-conditions add extra rules to decide who can see and get your offers. Therefore, only targeted customers can see and apply the offer, while others won't see it at all.

{% hint style="info" %}
* These sub-conditions are optional. If you don't add any, the offer will be available to all customers.
* You can combine multiple sub-conditions. Customers must meet all selected criteria to qualify.
{% endhint %}

1. _Specific link address_ – Apply offers to customers accessing your store from a specific link. Perfect for email campaigns, social posts, or affiliates.
2. _Order history_ – Target customers based on purchase behavior. Best for rewarding first-time buyers, high spenders, and more.
3. _Customer tags_ – Show or hide offers based on customer tags.
4. _Customer location_ – Run country-specific promotions based on the customer’s IP address.
5. _Markets_ – Run region-specific offers based on your Shopify Markets.

### 3. Select bundle

#### 3.1 Bundle item level:

Select how each item in the bundle is counted.

* **Product level:** Each product counts as one bundle item. The widget displays each product as a single line item, with an option to select the preferred variant.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/unknown (7).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Variant level:** Each variant counts as one bundle item and is displayed as a separate line item on the widget.

#### 3.2 Bundle discount type

There are two separate options for you to set up your promotion campaigns.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (291).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**4 discount types**

* Percentage: percentage of the discount will be deducted from the total price of all products in bundle.
* Amount: an amount of money will be deducted from the total price of all products in bundle.&#x20;
* Fixed price: A specific price is set for all products in the bundle.
* Free gift: a free item that's automatically added to customer carts that meet the condition

**Shipping discount**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/unknown (111).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There are 2 types of shipping discount:

* Percentage: A percentage of the shipping cost will be deducted.
* Amount: A fixed amount will be deducted from the total shipping cost.

**Label on widget:** This text informs customers whether the bundle includes a shipping discount.&#x20;

**Add currency:** If you have Shopify Markets set up, you can customize how much discount amount to offer in each currency, instead of using Shopify’s exchange rates (e.g., SGD 10, CN¥8, A$12).

{% hint style="info" %}

<summary><strong>Can I combine a Classic Bundle discount with other Shopify discount codes?</strong></summary>

By default, BOGOS allows you to combine bundle discounts with order discounts and shipping discounts. However, you can choose to disable this feature in the "**Combination**" section of the settings.
